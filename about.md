Greetings!

My name is Jeff Naemura. Aside from the work samples provided on this site and the information provided in my résumé, I am a writer that always strives to incorporate the following principles in my technical communication.

## Audience-Focused

One of the first things I always define for my projects is determine the target audience and gear my writing to that group. I feel that is one of the best ways to ensure readers find the information they need and when they need it. This may include changing my writing style, adjusting the level of acceptable industry jargon, or incorporating more information architecture principles to the structure.

## Minimalism

My style of technical writing involves being as direct and concise as possible for the audience. I regularly look for opportunities to streamline how quickly readers can find needed information from documents. This includes streamlining text, utilizing formatting and whitespace, and optimizing visual aids.

## Docs-As-Code

If there are opportunities to automate processes or reduce mistakes in the writing process, I am always interested. I see inherit value in the power of tracking changes between, say, Git commits or the ability to modularize content for content reuse or single-source-to-multiple-output automation.

## Flexibility

I believe technical writers should be able to produce concise documentation for any industry or topic. Therefore, I strive to keep myself up-to-date with the latest skills and trends in the technical writing industry--whether or not my current employer has an immediate need.
