## Summary

The following document is an example of a user guide I authored from product development to release. It is provided online (PDF) for free but has since been updated on the website. The project was to provide detailed information about a series of audio and video scalers. It was only provided on the company website.


## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to collaborate with Product Development engineers and technical illustrators to generate text and visual aids for a technical US audience. I wrote the text and organized the topics. I also designed the visuals before requesting them from the illustrators. However, the styles and layout were designed by the department supervisor.

## Target Audience

* Certified installers
* Operators and administrators

## Tools

* Adobe InDesign
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator
