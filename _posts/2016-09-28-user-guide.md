[User Guide Sample](images/68-2290-01_G.pdf)

## Summary

This document is an example of a user guide or manual I authored from development to release. It is intended to be used in conjunction with a printed setup guide where a user may reference this user guide for more use and operation information.

It is provided online (PDF) only, but it has since been updated. This sample is from the last version I worked on the project.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to collaborate with Product Development engineers and technical illustrators to generate text and visual aids for a technical US audience. I wrote the text and organized the topics. I also designed the visuals before requesting them from the illustrators. However, the styles and layout were designed by the department supervisor.

The document was reviewed informally by product application engineers and other technical writers before being updated to the website through the company CMS. Approvals went through a SharePoint workflow.

## Target Audience

* Certified installers
* Operators and administrators

## Tools

* Adobe Acrobat Pro
* Adobe InDesign
