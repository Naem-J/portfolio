[User Guide Sample](images/68-2290-01_G.pdf)

## Summary

This is an example of a user-focused document for an audio/video switcher and scaler. It was the companyâ€™s next generation solution that combined different electrical concepts and added several new technologies. It was provided online in PDF format and intended to be used in conjunction with a printed setup guide.

The target audience of this document were for external certified installers and operators (often administrative personnel). The installers were expected to be highly technical while the operators potentially not as technical.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to collaborate with Product Development engineers to design and create the document from concept to release and support subsequent firmware updates and additional models. After being assigned the project, I worked as the sole technical writer and the driver of the documentation effort.

I used company InDesign templates and styles to format the content (for example, color schemes, whitespace manipulation, use of hyperlinks in callouts). However, I wrote text was based on technical documents I received from engineers and regular discussions with the project team. Illustrations were created by a technical illustrator but I handled callouts and raster screenshots.

The review process involved PDF shared reviews through SharePoint. After the review process, I was also responsible for releasing the document in the company CMS portal to be pushed to the company website.
