[Video Script Sample](images/video_script.pdf)

## Summary

This excerpt is an example of a script I created for a video demonstrating how to pack and transport medical equipment in custom containers and company vehicles. The script is an internal document, so the full version is not available.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities included converting a procedure document into a script for either an internal video creator or third-party vendor. I worked with the designer of the custom containers and author of the procedure to write the script. However, I did not create the video.

## Target Audience

* Video creator and editor
* Sales
* Marketing

## Tools

Microsoft Word
