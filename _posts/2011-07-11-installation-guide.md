[Installation Guide Sample](images/68-2160-01_A.pdf)

## Summary

This document is an example of a installation guide I authored from development to release. It was printed on a piece of cardstock and provided with the product.

The goal was to create procedural instructions for professional installers of rack-mounted equipment to install an add-on to low-profile devices. The available dimensions and thickness were limited due to packaging restrictions.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to collaborate with Product Development engineers and technical illustrators to generate text and visual aids for a technical US audience. I wrote and organized the text as well as defined what the visuals should demonstrate to the illustrators. Styles, colors, and formatting were standardized by the department supervisor.

The document was reviewed informally by product application engineers and other technical writers before being updated to the website through the company CMS. Approvals went through a SharePoint workflow.

## Target Audience
