## Summary

The following document is an example of a installation guide I authored from development to release. It was printed on a piece of cardstock and provided with the product to a technical audience. The project was to create procedural instructions for customers with limited space due to packaging. The product was an add-on for thin rack-mounted devices. This document is provided on the company website for free (PDF).

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to collaborate with Product Development engineers and technical illustrators to generate text and visual aids for a technical US audience. I wrote and organized the text as well as described what the visuals should demonstrate to the illustrators. Styles, colors, and formatting were standardized by the department supervisor.

## Target Audience

* Certified installers
* Operators and administrators

## Tools

* Adobe Illustrator
* Adobe Dreamweaver
