![Help File Sample](images/help_file_example.png)
*HTML output of a context-sensitive help file embedded within software*

## Summary

This is a screenshot of a context-sensitive help file that was embedded into software. The software is only available with the purchase of the accompanying hardware product, so the full help file on this site is not available. The screenshot was taken just prior to official release.

The software, itself, remotely configured the hardware device through an Ethernet connection. Otherwise, the rack-mounted device required physical interaction with the front panel buttons or a direct cable connection with a laptop.

The target audience included audio/video technicians and IT personnel. These groups were technical with some trained or certified by the company, Extron.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to create the help file from start to finish. I was also required to release it in the small window of time between software verification and validation and product release. I was expected to use the software during development and report bugs in Jira as well.

The styles and layout were standardized by others in the Technical Publications department, but another writer and I created the CSS and page layouts to conform the help files to the standards. Simultaneously, I was also expected to generate a PDF copy of the help file.

The file was sent through a peer and SME review process with PDF Shared Reviews in SharePoint. However, I had to manage the process in a fast-paced environment to ensure it was released in a small window between the software code freeze and the start of verification and validation.

## Tools Used
