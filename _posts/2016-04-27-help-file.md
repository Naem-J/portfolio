## Summary

The following screenshot shows a software help file I authored from development to release. It was embedded into the software and context-sensitive. The output format was in HTML and CSS. The software is only available to customers on the company website, so the full version is not available. However, the screenshot demonstrates a brief example of my writing style and the topic structure I utilized.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to create a single-source CSS file for multiple output types based on styles and formatting defined by the department supervisor and collaborate with Product Development engineers to generate the help file within quick software sprint cycles.

## Target Audience

* Operators and administrators
* IT personnel

## Tools

* Madcap Flare
* Adobe Dreamweaver
* Adobe Photoshop
