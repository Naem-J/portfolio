*HTML output of a context-sensitive help file embedded within software*

## Summary

This screenshot shows a software help file I authored from development to release. It was embedded into the software and made context-sensitive to UI icons or controls.

The software is only available to customers, so the entire help file is not readily available. However, the screenshot demonstrates a brief example of my writing style for help files and the topic structure I utilized.

## Responsibilities

For this project, I engaged the software engineers early in the development process to identify workflows and features, while simultaneously negotiating where and how often to utilize context-sensitive links. I was responsible for writing and generating the help file in HTML and CSS, a PDF copy of the help file, and a header file to link sections of the help file to parts of the software UI. Visual aids used in the help file were often screenshots manipulated by me to demonstrate potential use cases. I also created a single-sourced CSS file for PDF and web help outputs based on formatting requirements defined by the department supervisor. 

The project was built, reviewed, and released in tight windows between the code freeze and software validation and verification.
