## Summary

The following excerpt is an example of a test protocol I wrote for Quality Control to validate whether the Technical Publications department satisfied requirements to apply custom, client-side input validation to PDF checklists. The test protocol corresponds to specific requirements expressed in the user requirement specification (URS) document.

The test protocol is an internal document, so the full version is not available publicly. However, the excerpt demonstrates the depth of detail required of the writing. The document was also used in conjunction with a URS.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to detail the procedure necessary to verify and validate whether requirements from the URS were met. This included accounting for different potential input scenarios, including minimum and maximum limits, arithmetic with floating point numbers, string formatting, and international number formatting.

## Target Audience

* Quality control personnel
* Technical support engineers
* Technical writers

## Tools

Microsoft Word
