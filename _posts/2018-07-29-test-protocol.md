[Test Protocol Sample](images/eSTP_Test_Protocol.pdf)

## Summary

This excerpt is from a test protocol I wrote for Quality Control to verify that field inputs from a PDF form validate according to defined formatting or limits. It coincides with a user requirement specification (URS).

The test protocol is an internal document, so the full version is not available publicly. However, the excerpt demonstrates the depth of detail used.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to detail the procedures necessary to objectively verify and validate whether requirements from the URS were met. This included accounting for different potential input scenarios, including minimum and maximum limits, arithmetic with floating point numbers, string formatting, and international number formatting.

## Target Audience

* Quality control personnel
* Technical support engineers
* Technical writers

## Tools

Microsoft Word
