![Knowledge Base Page Sample](images/confluence_sample.png)

## Summary

This sample is from an internal knowledge base platform where I am a primary contributor. The space is used by the technical writing team to maintain processes and practices. In the sample, I provide instructions to use Git to clone a remote repository to a local destination. I used Confluence code macros and Snagit to create an animated .gif of the CLI commands.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities included working with an SME to determine the most important questions to answer (consolidating where possible). I organized the questions which were reviewed by the SME.

I was also responsible for the style and layout of the document. However, the color scheme was based on company brand guidelines.

## Target Audience

IT departments and personnel of medical practices, hospitals, or clinics

## Tools

* Atlassian Confluence
* TechSmith Snagit
