## Summary

The following document is an example of a setup guide I authored from product development to release. It is printed and accompanies the product. It is also provided online (PDF) for free but has since been updated on the website. The project was to provide brief setup and procedures for certified installers and third-party operators and administrators to install fit a fiber optic transmitter into several common floor boxes.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to collaborate with Product Development engineers and technical illustrators to generate text and visual aids for a technical US audience. I wrote the text and organized the topics. I also designed the visuals before requesting them from the illustrators. However, the styles and layout were standardized by the department supervisor.

## Target Audience

* Certified installers
* Operators and administrators

## Tools

* Adobe InDesign
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator

## Sample
