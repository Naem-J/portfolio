[Setup Guide Sample](images/68-2374-50_A.pdf)

## Summary

This document is an example of a setup guide I authored from development to release. It was intended to be printed and accompany the product hardware, but it is also provided online as a PDF.

The goal was to create brief setup procedures for certified installers to install fiber optic transmitters into several common floor boxes. If readers need more information, a more comprehensive user manual was provided online.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to collaborate with Product Development engineers and technical illustrators to generate text and visual aids for a technical US audience. I wrote the text and organized the topics. I also designed the visuals before requesting them from the illustrators. However, the styles and layout were standardized by the department supervisor.

The document was reviewed informally by product application engineers and other technical writers before being updated to the website through the company CMS. Approvals went through a SharePoint workflow.

## Target Audience

* Certified installers
* Operators and administrators

## Tools
