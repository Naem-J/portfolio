[Setup Guide Sample](images/68-2374-50_A.pdf)

## Summary

This is an example of a setup or installation guide for an audio/video transmitter that fits into several different third party floor boxes. The guide was printed and included with the device for professional installers to install the transmitter and set up the necessary connections for customer use. A more comprehensive user guide was provided through the company website. The transmitter was one of many options in the companyâ€™s XTP product line that was the highest priority project in the company at the time.

The target audience for this guide included company-certified or, otherwise, professional installers of the transmitter. The company did not assume responsibility for the installation of the third party floor boxes.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to collaborate with engineers and technical illustrators to create the setup guide from product proposal to completion. I had to incorporate the guide as part of the documentation provided with the devices (also included a user guide and technical specifications) as well as ensure it was aligned with the documentation created for the entire XTP line (which I was also responsible for).

I used company InDesign templates and styles to format the content (for example, color schemes, whitespace manipulation, use of hyperlinks in callouts). However, I wrote text was based on technical documents I received from engineers and regular discussions with the project team.

Illustrations of the floor boxes and how the transmitter interacted with the floor boxes were created by a technical illustrator with my instructions. However, I added callouts and leader lines.

The review process involved PDF shared reviews through SharePoint. After the review process, I was also responsible for releasing the document in the company CMS portal to be pushed to the company website.
