[User Requirement Specification Sample](images/eSTP_URS.pdf)

## Summary

This excerpt from a user requirement specification I wrote for the Technical Support department. The project involved applying JavaScript to a PDF form created by technical services engineers to customize input validation and perform arithmetic. The document coincides with a test protocol to validate the project is complete.

The URS is an internal document, so the full version is not available publicly. However, the full document required compliance with good documentation practices (GDP) and calibration specifications.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities included interviewing technical service engineers and technical specifications to determine pratical workflows and input validation requirements. Technical services engineers deteremined the types of data needed and how to collect the data. I wrote the document, but the format is based on a company URS template.

## Target Audience
