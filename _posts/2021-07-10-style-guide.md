## Summary

The following excerpts are examples of a comprehensive style guide I created for the Technical Publications team. During a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt project I planned and implemented, this was identified as a gap in mistake proofing our development and review process. The project required standardizing both basic and deep writing topics as well as defining how visual aids should appear. The style guide worked in conjunction with a preparation and review checklist to ensure authors and reviewers were held to the same expectations.

The style guide is an internal document, so the full version is not available publically. However, the excerpts demonstrate the level of detail required to educate and ensure the responsibility of other technical writers to each other and their writing.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities included educating other technical writers in basic grammar and punctuation rules, identifying subjective writing topics to standardize, and providing guidance on best practices for visual aid design and maintenance. For reference, the style guide covered the following high-level topics:
* Parts of speech
* Syntax (including use of phrases, flow, and complexity)
* Language (including clarity, jargon, formality, and consistency)
* Spelling and formatting (including capitalization, formatting numbers, and formatting other types of terms)
* Punctuation
* Styles (including whitespace and alignment manipulation)
* Visual aids (including scope, callouts, and leader lines)

## Target Audience

* Internal technical writers (authors and reviewers)
* External technical writers
* Technical Publications manager

## Tools

Microsoft Word
