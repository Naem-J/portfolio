[SOP for Creating User-Facing Documents](images/om_creation_process_redacted.pdf)

## Summary

This excerpt is an example of a standard operating procedure (SOP) I authored as part of a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt project. It was identified as a gap in the Technical Publications department and helped mitigate errors in the development and review cycles when creating user documentation.

The SOP is an internal document, so the full version is not available. However, the excerpt demonstrates a process flow chart and some basic administrative elements required to release the SOP in the company Quality Control system.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to record the workflow and decision making process of technical writers creating customer-facing documentation. In conjunction with this SOP, I also created preparation and review checklists as controlled documents. However, the release process SOPs already existed at the time.

## Target Audience

* Quality control personnel
* Technical writers

## Tools

* Microsoft Word
* Microsoft Visio
