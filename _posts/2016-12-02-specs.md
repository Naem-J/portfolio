[Product Specification Sample](images/XTP_SR_HD_4K_D2_120216.pdf)

## Summary

This document is an example of a product specifications sheet I created for internal and external audiences. It is provided on the company website as a web page and a PDF, but it has since been updated. This document represents the last version I worked on.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to collect data from technical product proposals, test results, and marketing strategy presentations to add and organize key-value pairs to the company CMS portal. After completion, a system administrator exported the results to Adobe InDesign. The layout and styles were standardized by the department supervisor.

Once in InDesign, I fixed any formatting issues that were introduced in the export process and generated a PDF. Then, I uploaded the PDF to the CMS site for publication to the company website.

## Target Audience

* Customers and prospective customers (technical)
* Product development engineers

## Tools

* Content management system (CMS)
* Adobe InDesign
* Adobe Acrobat
