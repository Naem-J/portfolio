## Summary

The following document is an example of product specifications I created from information provided by product development engineers and marketing strategists. It was provided the company website as a web page and a PDF, but it has since been updated.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were collect data from product proposals, test results, and marketing strategy presentations to populate specification values in the company content management system to both be added to the website and exported to a PDF. I organized the information and formatted the values, but the style and layout of the PDF were standardized by the department supervisor.

## Target Audience
