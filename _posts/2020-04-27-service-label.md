![Service Label Sample](images/label_workspace.png)
*XML data set of localized content that matches Illustrator variables*

## Summary

This screenshot shows the Adobe Illustrator template I created for a label that adheres to the outside of hardware (product-independent). The template imported an XML file of translated and localized text for over 100 countries. Each country label needed to be released simultaneously in a component CMS.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities were to design the label to be small to fit on our smallest devices and batteries while making them large enough to write on. I also built the template in Adobe Illustrator to import the XML file, change the text for each country, and batch output separate labels for each country.

Translations and localization were done by global affiliates. Printed material and vendor choices were made by technical services engineer.

## Target Audience
