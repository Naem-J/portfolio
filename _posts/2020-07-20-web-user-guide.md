## Summary

The following document is a converted user guide I originally authored for print. The original document was previously converted from an existing Microsoft Word document in poor condition from an acquired company (the company did not have dedicated writers to create the document). The entire document was completely rewritten and the images were all replaced. The original document is provided in PDF form online for free, but has since been updated. The project was to provide safety, use, and maintenance information for a medical device.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities for the original document included interpreting explanations from a Research and Development department acquired by the company, illustrating isometric and orthographic projections of individual system components and combined assemblies from CAD drawings, designing the visual styles based off the corporate brand guidelines and technical communication techniques, and creating the entire document.

For the web-based document, I parsed the content from a binary file into modular topics (markdown files). I utilized a free Hugo theme to create the layout and published it to GitHub. Content was created with markdown, HTML, and CSS. Styles were predominately provided by the theme creator, but slightly manipulated using TOML and CSS.

## Target Audience

* Ophthalmic surgeons
* Surgical staff
* IT departments
* Responsible organizations (owners of the equipment)

## Tools

* Atom
* Adobe Illustrator
* Hugo
