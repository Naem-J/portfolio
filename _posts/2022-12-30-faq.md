[FAQ Sample](images/networking_faq.pdf)

## Summary

This FAQ answers many common questions the company receives when working with a new client with HIPAA and cybersecurity concerns. Questionnaires are often sent to the company by prospective clients which are the inspiration for most of the questions. The questions are organized by the cybersecurity CIA triad concept.

## Responsibilities

My responsibilities included working with an SME to determine the most important questions to answer (consolidating where possible). I organized the questions which were reviewed by the SME.

I was also responsible for the style and layout of the document. However, the color scheme was based on company brand guidelines.

## Target Audience

IT departments and personnel of medical practices, hospitals, or clinics

## Tools

Microsoft Word
